# AETOAB
AETOAB is an AI Chatbot with a focus on Discord and Twitch entertainment. :)

AETOAB uses a few dependencies, which are listed in the imports at the top of AEChatBot.py. IDK how to add these to project without manually adding every script from those dependencies. Just use your imagination. (Maybe I should list the dependencies and their pip commands but idk.)

Anyway AETOAB is just a proof of concept. He runs on Chatterbot which I would argue is a suboptimimal engine, because I can't correct for validation loss or any of that fancy stuff. Planning to make a version on the PyTorch framework.

Additionally there is a version of his dataset on Repl.it here: https://replit.com/@ROBERTBOL/AETOAB-Cloud-Dataset-Update This is updated far more often than the one here.
